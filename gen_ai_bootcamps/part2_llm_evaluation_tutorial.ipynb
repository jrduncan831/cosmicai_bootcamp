Torchtune integrates with <a href=\"https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\">EleutherAIâ€™s evaluation harness</a> which provides access to many different generation benchmarks.  As an example, we can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA\">TruthfulQA</a> benchmark which evaluates the model's ability to generate factually correct answers to a question. There are several different testing methods offered in this benchmark, in our case we will be running MC2 in which the model attempts to chose which of the multiple choice responses are true given a particular question. Note, the benchmark takes ~20 minutes to complete."
