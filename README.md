# CosmicAI Bootcamp

## Running Notebooks on Frontera

We have a container set up to run the following tutorials on frontera from our recent 2 day tutorial: 

- intro deep learning
- generative ai and llms
- unsupervised learning
- surrogate modelling

For our trainings we use containerized kernels and have participants access jupyter noteboosk on compute nodes through the [TACC  Analysis Portal](https://tap.tacc.utexas.edu/).
The following script will set up a containerized kernel for jupyter notebooks and copy notebooks listed above to your home directory:

/scratch1/10386/lsmith9003/share/container_setup_spring_25/install

When running the notebooks, be sure to check that the kernel says ML-Tutorial-March-2025.  If notebooks is not using this kernel then Click Kernel-> Change Kernel -> ML-Tutorial-March-2025.
